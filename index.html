            <h2>Push-Ups</h2>
            <img src="pushups.jpg" alt="Push-Ups">
            <p>Begin in a plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Lower your body until your chest nearly touches the floor, then push yourself back up. Keep your core tight and back straight throughout the exercise.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="exercise">
            <h2>Squats</h2>
            <img src="squats.jpg" alt="Squats">
            <p>Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Lower your body as if you're sitting back into a chair, keeping your chest up and knees behind your toes. Go as low as you can, then stand back up by driving through your heels.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="exercise">
            <h2>Plank</h2>
            <img src="plank.jpg" alt="Plank">
            <p>Start in a push-up position but with your weight resting on your forearms instead of your hands. Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels, and hold this position while engaging your core muscles.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="exercise">
            <h2>Bicep Curls</h2>
            <img src="bicepcurls.jpg" alt="Bicep Curls">
            <p>Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing forward. Keep your elbows close to your torso as you curl the weights while contracting your biceps. Lower the weights back down slowly and repeat.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="exercise">
            <h2>Lunges</h2>
            <img src="lunges.jpg" alt="Lunges">
            <p>Stand upright and take a step forward with one leg, lowering your hips until both knees are bent at a 90-degree angle. Ensure your front knee is directly above your ankle and your back knee doesn't touch the floor. Push back up to the starting position and repeat with the other leg.</p>
